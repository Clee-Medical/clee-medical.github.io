## About Us
<br>

At Clee Medical, we're pioneering the next generation of medical imaging technology to empower neurosurgeons with real-time images and insights during procedures. Our current focus is a groundbreaking medical device leveraging Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to provide live, high-resolution images from within the brain.  

We're now seeking an experienced and ambitious Software Engineer to own the next phase of our real-time data processing and visualization stack—ultimately becoming the foundation for a larger software team as we scale.

## Role Overview
<br>

This role is ideal for a hands-on engineer with a background in medical software development and familiar with IEC 62304 standard. You’ll play a central role in shaping the software architecture of our OCT system, translating our functional prototype into a compliant, robust, and production-grade codebase.

You will:

-	Architect and implement software for real-time acquisition, processing, and visualization of OCT data.
-	Ensure the software development process adheres to IEC 62304 and other relevant standards (e.g., ISO 14971, ISO 13485).
-	Collaborate closely with hardware, QA/RA, and clinical experts to align system requirements with software implementation.
-	Lead documentation efforts and establish processes for traceability, risk management, and verification.

## Key Responsibilities
<br>

-	Redesign and rebuild core components of our existing OCT software for robustness, maintainability, and compliance.
-	Develop and integrate real-time pipelines for signal processing, image rendering (2D/3D), and user interaction.
-	Set up testing, version control, and documentation workflows aligned with medical device lifecycle regulations.
-	Interface with regulatory consultants and prepare for formal submissions.
-	Help recruit and mentor future engineers as the team grows.

## Required Qualifications
<br>

-	5+ years of experience in software engineering, with at least 2 years in medical devices.
-	Deep understanding of IEC 62304, including experience with compliant software projects.
-	Experience with real-time systems, multithreading, and GPU acceleration.
-	Familiarity with OCT systems, medical imaging (e.g., ultrasound, MRI), or related high-data-rate acquisition systems.
-	Experience in one or more of the following: Qt, VTK/ITK, CUDA/OpenCL, GPGPU frameworks, or image processing libraries.
-	Strong documentation and communication skills, comfortable in cross-functional teams.

## Nice to Have
<br>

-	Experience with class B and C medical software development.
-	Experience with ISO 13485, ISO 14971, or FDA Class II/III submissions.
-	Experience in implementing computer vision (U-net, CNN, etc.) algorithms.
-	UI/UX design for clinical applications.

## Why Join Us?
<br>

-	Be part of a mission-driven company at an early stage.
-	Work on cutting-edge medical imaging technology with real impact on patient care.
-	Take ownership of a software platform.
-	Flexible work arrangements and the opportunity to shape a medical device from the ground up.
-	Collaborate with top-tier engineers and world-class clinicians in an intellectually stimulating and impactful environment.

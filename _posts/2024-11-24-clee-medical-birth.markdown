#### Clee Medical, a neuro technology start up focused on transforming the landscape of brain treatments.
Officially incorporated in October 2024, Clee Medical is proud to spin out of the Wyss Center in Geneva, Switzerland. With a vision to revolutionize neurointerventional precision and outcomes, Clee Medical is at the forefront of developing cutting-edge, minimally invasive neurotechnologies that empower clinicians with real-time imaging, AI-driven navigation, and machine learning insights for true confidence in neural targeting.
Clee Medical’s flagship technology integrates ultra-high-resolution, real-time intraoperative imaging with AI-based navigation and machine learning detection of neuroanatomy and vasculature. This powerful combination gives surgeons unprecedented visibility and decision-making support, ensuring access to the most precise areas of the brain while minimizing risk to surrounding critical structures.

<blockquote>
  At Clee Medical, we are driven by a singular mission: to unlock new possibilities in brain surgery and neuro therapies, by providing surgeons with actionable, real-time insights and advanced tools for intraoperative precision, we aim to make brain surgery <strong>faster, safer, and more accurate</strong>—ultimately improving outcomes for patients and surgeons alike.
  <small>Matthew Lapinski, Co-Founder and CEO</small>

Brain surgery is among the most complex and challenging procedures in modern medicine. Surgeons often face limited visibility, unpredictable anatomy, and the constant need to balance precision with speed. Clee Medical’s technology bridges these gaps by:
Enhancing Surgical Visualization: Real-time, high-resolution imaging that reveals fine neuroanatomical structures and vasculature.
Guiding Surgeons with AI Navigation: Tools to enable safer surgical paths, reduce surgical time, and increase therapeutic effect.
Delivering Precision Through Learning: Algorithms that detect critical tissues for better real-time decision making.
By addressing these challenges, Clee Medical is paving the way for greater surgical targeting, reduced complications, and a new era of precision based neural therapies for a wide range of indications.
Clee Medical’s ambition goes beyond today’s surgical solutions. By combining its advanced imaging and AI capabilities, the company seeks to enable the next generation of highly targeted neuro therapies - ensuring the precise treatment of neurological conditions with minimal invasiveness.
<blockquote>
“Our technology represents a leap forward in enabling surgeons to treat the brain with the accuracy it deserves. We envision a future where our platform not only improves surgical outcomes but also becomes a foundation for highly targeted therapies that were previously unimaginable.”
  <small>Dr. Abed Hammoud, Co-Founder and CTO</small>

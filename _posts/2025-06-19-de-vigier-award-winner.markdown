## Clee Medical honored with the W.A De Vigier award 2025, one of Switzlerandâ€™s most prestigious prizes for entrepreneurs and start ups. ðŸŽ‰  <br>
<br>
This recognition fuels our mission to enable safer, more precise access to the brain by combining novel real-time ultra-high-resolution imaging with AI-guided navigation to treat neurological conditions ranging from neurostimulation, epilepsy, cancer, and beyond.

This milestone wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the incredible support from our partners, advisors, investors, and early clinical collaborations. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who believes in our vision and pushes us forward every day.

A special thanks to the W.A. De Vigier Stiftung for believing in deeptech innovation and to our amazing fellow finalists.

Onwards as we forge a new era of highly targeted neuro therapies!

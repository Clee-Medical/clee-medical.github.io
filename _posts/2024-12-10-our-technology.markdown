Brain surgery traditionally relies on pre-operative MRI imaging, which often falls short in enabling precise targeting during procedures. At Clee Medical, we’ve developed a groundbreaking solution: real-time, ultra-high-resolution brain visualization during surgery—live, without the need for contrast agents or radiation. We are setting a new standard in neuroimaging, seamlessly bridging the gap between preoperative diagnostics and real-time surgical precision.

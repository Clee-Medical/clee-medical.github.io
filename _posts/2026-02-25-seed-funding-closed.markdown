**Geneva, Switzerland, 25 February 2026** - Clee Medical, a Swiss neurotechnology startup developing novel ultra-high-resolution real-time imaging for brain surgery, today announced the successful closing of its Seed financing round. The round was led by High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), one of Europe’s most active early-stage investors, with participation from Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), Kickfund, FONGIT, and Venture Kick. The company also benefits from the continued participation from their existing partner and investor, Wyss Geneva.

The financing will enable Clee Medical to accelerate the development and clinical validation of its Neuro Access platform, a minimally invasive technology designed to help neurosurgeons visualize brain anatomy and critical structures in real time during stereotactic procedures.

“Neurosurgery still relies heavily on pre-operative imaging, while the reality in the operating room is dynamic and uncertain,” said Matthew Lapinski, Co-Founder and CEO of Clee Medical. “This Seed round allows us to bring a new level of real-time visibility into the brain, supporting safer procedures and expanding what minimally invasive neurosurgery can achieve.”

### Improving surgical precision in a high-risk environment

Many neurosurgical procedures depend on navigating delicate brain structures with millimeter-level precision. Yet during surgery, anatomical shifts and limited intraoperative visibility can make targeting challenging. Clee Medical’s Neuro Access platform is designed to address this gap by providing real-time, ultra-high-resolution imaging inside the brain, supporting surgeons in navigating complex anatomy with greater confidence.
The company’s technology builds on years of translational research and is being developed with the goal of supporting a wide range of applications, including functional neurosurgery and neuro-oncology.

### Funding will accelerate clinical validation and regulatory progress

With the Seed financing, Clee Medical plans to expand its development and clinical programs and advance toward key milestones required for early clinical adoption, specifically their first in human clinical study. 
“Clee Medical is addressing a critical unmet need in neurosurgery: the ability to see relevant structures in real time during minimally invasive procedures,” said Tilmann Petersen, Investment Manager at HTGF. “We are glad to back such an experienced team — proven through the development and successful exits of today’s market standard neurosurgical devices such as the Stealth Station — and believe they have the technical depth and clinical focus to build a category defining platform in neurotechnology.”

### A milestone for Swiss neurotechnology innovation

The Seed round marks a major step in Clee Medical’s transition from preclinical development into clinical translation. Supported by a strong European investor syndicate and the continued backing of Wyss Geneva, the company is positioned to advance Neuro Access toward real-world use in the operating room.
Clee Medical’s long-term vision is to enable a future where neurosurgeons can operate with enhanced real-time insight, improving safety, efficiency, and outcomes for patients undergoing complex brain procedures.
The company is led by co-founders Matt Lapinski and Abed Hammoud. Matt brings more than a decade of experience building and scaling Class III medical device startups in the United States. Abed has contributed to the development of market-leading neurosurgical systems, including Medtronic’s StealthStation stereotactic platform and Renishaw’s NeuroMate robotic system, bringing deep expertise in precision neurotechnology and surgical navigation.

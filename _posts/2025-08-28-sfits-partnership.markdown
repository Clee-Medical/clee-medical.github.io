Clee Medical is proud to announce a strategic partnership with the Swiss Foundation for Innovation and Training in Surgery (SFITS) to accelerate the clinical validation and adoption of its real-time intraoperative imaging and AI-guided navigation technology. <br> <br>

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in Clee Medical’s mission to empower neurosurgeons with real-time visualization of brain anatomy and vasculature at unprecedented precision. By integrating ultra-high-resolution imaging with AI-based anatomical detection, the company’s Neuro Access platform aims to enhance surgical accuracy, improve patient safety, and expand access to advanced neurotherapies. <br> <br>


Working alongside SFITS, a leading European center for surgical training and innovation, the partnership will also enable early integration of Neuro Access into surgical training programs. This hands-on collaboration will foster direct feedback from clinicians and accelerate technology refinement under real-world conditions. <br> <br>

<blockquote>
“Partnering with SFITS allows us to demonstrate and evolve our technology within one of the most advanced surgical innovation environments in Europe,</blockquote> said Matthew Lapinski, CEO of Clee Medical. <blockquote>It’s an important step toward bringing safer, more precise, and more effective neurosurgery to patients worldwide.</blockquote>

## Clee Medical honored with the W.A De Vigier award 2025, one of Switzlerandâ€™s most prestigious prizes for entrepreneurs and start ups. ðŸŽ‰  <br>
<br>
This recognition fuels our mission to enable safer, more precise access to the brain by combining novel real-time ultra-high-resolution imaging with AI-guided navigation to treat neurological conditions ranging from neurostimulation, epilepsy, cancer, and beyond.

This milestone wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the incredible support from our partners, advisors, investors, and early clinical collaborations. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who believes in our vision and pushes us forward every day.

A special thanks to the W.A. De Vigier Stiftung for believing in deeptech innovation and to our amazing fellow finalists.

Onwards as we forge a new era of highly targeted neuro therapies!


Clee Medical is proud to announce a strategic partnership with the Swiss Foundation for Innovation and Training in Surgery (SFITS) to accelerate the clinical validation and adoption of its real-time intraoperative imaging and AI-guided navigation technology. <br> <br>

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in Clee Medicalâ€™s mission to empower neurosurgeons with real-time visualization of brain anatomy and vasculature at unprecedented precision. By integrating ultra-high-resolution imaging with AI-based anatomical detection, the companyâ€™s Neuro Access platform aims to enhance surgical accuracy, improve patient safety, and expand access to advanced neurotherapies. <br> <br>


Working alongside SFITS, a leading European center for surgical training and innovation, the partnership will also enable early integration of Neuro Access into surgical training programs. This hands-on collaboration will foster direct feedback from clinicians and accelerate technology refinement under real-world conditions. <br> <br>

<blockquote>
â€œPartnering with SFITS allows us to demonstrate and evolve our technology within one of the most advanced surgical innovation environments in Europe,</blockquote> said Matthew Lapinski, CEO of Clee Medical. <blockquote>Itâ€™s an important step toward bringing safer, more precise, and more effective neurosurgery to patients worldwide.</blockquote>

<br> <br>

Dr. Jelena Godjevac, CEO of SFITS, added: <blockquote>We are delighted to welcome Clee Medical to our ecosystem. Their real-time neuroimaging and navigation platform represents the kind of innovation that advances surgical excellence and patient outcomes.</blockquote>
<br> <br>

This partnership reinforces Clee Medicalâ€™s commitment to bridging the gap between next-generation neurotechnology and clinical practice and is a significant step forward towards a new era of patient-centered innovation in neurosurgery.

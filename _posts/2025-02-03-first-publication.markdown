#### Exciting Milestone: Our First Scientific Paper Published in Biomedical Optics Express!

We are thrilled to announce the publication of our first scientific technical paper, "Minimally-invasive common-path OCT system for neurosurgery applications" in Biomedical Optics Express. This marks a significant milestone for our team at Clee Medical as we advance the frontiers of neurosurgical imaging technology.

Our research presents a groundbreaking optical coherence tomography (OCT) system tailored specifically for neurosurgery. This minimally invasive, forward-viewing, common-path OCT system operates at 1310 nm and features real-time 3D imaging capabilities. Designed with a novel monolithic endoscope, the system enhances the accuracy of stereotactic surgeries such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and biopsies by providing real-time tissue identification and blood flow detection, significantly reducing the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage.

Key highlights from our paper include:

- Innovative Design: A compact, monolithic endoscope with a common-path configuration simplifies setup and minimizes polarization artifacts.

- Real-Time Imaging: High-resolution 3D imaging for precise tissue differentiation and vascular structure identification.

- Preclinical Validation: Successful in vivo testing in a rabbit model demonstrated the systemâ€™s ability to improve surgical precision and safety.

This research is a testament to our commitment to developing cutting-edge medical technologies that enhance patient outcomes and surgical accuracy. We extend our gratitude to our collaborators at the Wyss Center for Bio and NeuroEngineering, Printoptix, and our esteemed partners in neurosurgery for their contributions.

We invite you to read the full paper [here](https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-16-2-872&id=567620) (open access) and join us in celebrating this achievement as we continue to innovate in the field of biomedical optics and targeted neurotherapies.
